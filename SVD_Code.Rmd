## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#import library needed to open jpg in R
library(jpeg)
#import library needed to for SVD calculations in R
library(svd)
#load in image and create a matrix representation of it  
quote_photo<-readJPEG('quote.jpg')
#get dimensions of matrix
nrow(quote_photo)
ncol(quote_photo)
#as returned by nrow and ncol, the dimensions of the matrix representation of the 
#image is 2952x5248 

#separate the matrix into equally size arrays of red, green, and blue color values 
#notice that the dimensions of each of these arrays is equal to that of the matrix
#representation of the image.
red<-quote_photo[,,1]
green<-quote_photo[,,2]
blue<-quote_photo[,,3]
#perform SVD on the extracted matrices that represent the individual RGB color values
#using R's built in SVD function
quote_photo_red<-svd(red)
quote_photo_green<-svd(green)
quote_photo_blue<-svd(blue)
#put the resulting decompositions into a list
rgblist<-list(quote_photo_red, quote_photo_green, quote_photo_blue)
#now that the SVDs have been calculated for the RGB color value matrices
#we can take the resulting matrix factorizations to reconstruct the original 
#image (matrix) using the equation A=UEV^T

#The for loop below takes each decomposed color matrix and reconstructs the color value array that comprises the original image with increasing ranks. The loop approximates the original image with eight different rank values starting from rank 2 to rank 1500. The writeJPEG() function takes the approximated color value array and writes it to a .jpeg.

use_4_sequence<<-nrow(quote_photo)/2
for (j in seq.int(2, round(use_4_sequence, -2), length.out = 8)) {
  a <- sapply(rgblist, function(i) {
    photo.compress <- i$u[,1:j] %*% diag(i$d[1:j]) %*% t(i$v[,1:j])
  }, simplify = 'array')
  
  writeJPEG(a, paste('quote_photo_compressed', '_svd_rank_', round(j,0), '.jpg', sep=''))
}

#The rank value at which the new jpeg outputs appear to be of equal quality to the original quote_photo appears to be 216. This image is included in my submission on canvas. Below I've calculated how much smaller the compressed image file size is than the original.

original_quote_photo_size_in_kb<-5981
#at rank 216
compressed_quote_photo_size_in_kb<-1205
(perecentage_of_original_size<-(compressed_quote_photo_size_in_kb/original_quote_photo_size_in_kb))

#After SVD, the compressed image is 20% of the original size and the same quality. SWEET!
```
